# LSTM based character level language model

Here is a PyTorch implementation of a character level language model trained on the tinyshakespeare dataset.

This implementation is highly inspired by Andrej Karpathys blog post [The Unreasonable Evvectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and his GitHub repositiories on [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) and [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore). The tinyshakespeare dataset is also a creation of Andrej Karpathy.
